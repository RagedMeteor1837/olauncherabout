title: About OLauncher

The old launcher we all know and love with the quality-of-life features of the new launcher. This aims to support java 8 through modern java.

***Project Status:***
This project is maintained on a best-effort basis and updates will only be made when I have the time. The fork was originally created to ensure the launcher could display new update notes and similar fixes. There are currently no planned features beyond this scope.
